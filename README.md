Welcome to the Golf Play Analytics Dashboard, a tool for golf enthusiasts. This dashboard is built using Streamlit and offers a range of features to help you analyze golf ball trajectories and identify golfer postures using the TFLite Movenet Thunder model.

## Features

### 1. Predicting and Visualizing Golf Ball Trajectory

With this feature, you can:

- **Input Swing Data**: Enter essential details about the golf swing, such as club selection, swing speed, and angle of attack.
- **Visualize Trajectory**: The algorithm will calculate and predict the trajectory of the golf ball based on your input data, while accounting for the applied spin/Magnus effect and Air Resistance. The trajectory is displayed graphically, making it easy to understand and analyze.

### 2. Identifying Golfer Posture using TFLite Movenet Thunder Computer Vision Model

This feature allows you to:

- **Upload Video Footage**: Simply upload, link, capture, or choose form the local dataase, a video of a golfer's swing.
- **Golfer Posture Analysis**: Our integrated TFLite Movenet Thunder CV model will analyze the golfer's posture throughout the swing.
- **Visual Feedback**: Receive visual feedback on key posture elements, such as body alignment, and posture angles.
